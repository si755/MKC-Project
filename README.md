# Construction Data Analytics and Process Optimization
This repository demonstrates work completed during my internship at MKC Infrastructure Ltd. The project focused on leveraging data analytics and real-time monitoring to optimize construction operations and supply chain management.

## Objectives
- Ensure accuracy in structural planning and project data analysis.
- Reduce operational time and supply chain disruptions using data-driven insights.
- Develop predictive models for resource forecasting and automation of workflows.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Databases:** SQL for querying and organizing datasets.
- **Visualization:** Power BI and Excel.
- **Real-Time Integration:** Sensor data monitoring using Python.

## Key Contributions
1. Built predictive models to forecast material requirements, reducing supply chain disruptions by 20%.
2. Integrated real-time sensor data for improved monitoring and operational efficiency.
3. Automated workflows to streamline on-site data collection and reporting.
4. Created dashboards highlighting KPIs such as cost overruns and resource usage.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Sample datasets used for analysis and modeling.
- `scripts/`: Python and SQL scripts for data processing, predictive modeling, and workflow automation.
- `dashboards/`: Power BI dashboard file showcasing project insights.
- `visualizations/`: Sample visualizations generated from the analysis.
- `docs/`: Project documentation and example reports.
  
## Result  
- Achieved a 25% reduction in operational time and improved forecasting accuracy.
- Enabled better decision-making with quality-validated data and automated workflows.
